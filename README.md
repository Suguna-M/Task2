# Task2
Today I'm doing my day2 task which focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Objective

The primary objectives achieved by these code snippets are:
* To load the dataset and generate comprehensive summary statistics for all columns.
* To visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms.
* To identify outliers and understand the spread of numerical features using box plots.
* To visualize the linear relationships between numerical features using a correlation heatmap.
* To understand pairwise relationships and distributions among numerical features using a pairplot.

Tools and Libraries Used

* *Python:* The programming language.
* *Pandas:* For efficient data loading and manipulation.
* *Matplotlib:* For creating basic plots.
* *Seaborn:* For creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.

Code Steps & Analysis

Step 1: Data Loading and Summary Statistics
This initial step involves loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and immediately generating a comprehensive statistical summary.
Step 2: Univariate Analysis (Histograms & Box Plots)
This step focuses on univariate analysis for numerical features.
Step 3: Correlation Analysis (Heatmap & Pairplot)
This step explores relationships between all numerical features.
Step 4: Missing Values and Unique Counts
This step explicitly quantifies missing values and unique entries for each column.
Step 5: Focused Correlation & Pairplot with Survival
This step refines the correlation and pairplot analysis by focusing on a subset of key numerical features and, importantly, by using Survived as a hue (color) in the pairplot.
